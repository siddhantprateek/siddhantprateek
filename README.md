## About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm **Siddhant** ü§ô, I believe you just found your Engineering Team Member. Love crafting cool stuff and helping out people. Let's build some cool stuff together. 

I'm not afraid of someone who has used multiple stacks, but someone who has used the same stack multiple times.

### Professional Experiences

Curr:

Ex: MLOps / DevOps Engineer at [Ai Planet](https://github.com/aiplanethub)

My professional journey I started my coding career by learning Frontend, mostly React, but I was not limited to it. I can also work with Next. 
I'm rather competent, but I wouldn't call myself an expert in that area. 

Though my work primarily highlights my backend expertise. However, I prefer to be recognized as a **generalist** who is equally skilled in frontend development and various other stacks, making me a versatile and well-rounded engineer.

**On a daily basis,**
1. I deal with REST/gRPC/Message Brokers.
2. Develop CI/CD pipelines, and work on GitOps with Argo.
3. Managing and optimising cloud spending on AWS and GCP.
4. I mostly spent my time debugging on the Kubernetes cluster.
5. If I have some free time from work, I try to contribute to open-source projects.
